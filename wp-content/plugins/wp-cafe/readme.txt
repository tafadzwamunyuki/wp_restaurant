This helps to generate more sales.

When your customer is at the checkout page, WPCafe will suggest the closest best food item the customer can buy if they are willing to pay a little more extra. This is called an order bump. 

Order bump is one of the [most effective techniques to increase sales](https://themewinter.com/how-wpcafe-help-to-boost-sales-on-your-restaurant/#:~:text=Boost%20Sales%20for%20Your%20Restaurant%20with%20Order%20Bump) in today’s ecommerce business scenes.
